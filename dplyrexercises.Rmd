# Exercise 1
Load dplyr, add the row names as a column in the data frame
```{r}
library(dplyr)
mtcars %>%
  mutate(makenmodel = row.names(mtcars)) ->
  newmtcars

identical(mtcars, newmtcars)
```

# Exercise 2
Identify the average mpg by number of cylinders
```{r}
newmtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
```

# Exercise 3
Find the top 10 cars by horsepower 
```{r}
newmtcars %>%
  arrange(desc(hp)) %>%
  head(10)
```

# Exercise 4
Do a linear regression of mpg by some columns
```{r}
newmtcars %>%
  lm(mpg~cyl+hp+wt, data= . )
```

# Exercise 5
Are there any gas-guzzling 4-cylinder cars? i.e. how many cars have *lower* than average mpg but have only 4 cylinders

```{r}
newmtcars %>% 
  filter( mpg < mean(mpg)) %>%
  filter( cyl==4 )
```
